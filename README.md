These were the datasets used for some exploratory analysis. The results of which can be found under data -> clean -> country.
Their respective notebooks along with all other notebooks for this project are stored unter the notebooks tab.

#### Notebooks
This tab stores all the python scripts used for this project.
In week 1 the notebooks are used for an innitial data analysis.
Week 2 introduces the classical models and the ML models. The fundamental of the project are laid down in this part. The polish_model_clean notebook has some explanation and documentation for what we have done. 
In week 3 we decided to focus on the Taiwan data since it had the most financial ratios. In this part we also add size analysis and variance analysis along with updated plots.

#### Results 
Contains some figures, but most of them were directly copied from the notebook into the presentatin.
