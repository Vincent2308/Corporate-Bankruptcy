Altman Z-score
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altman.asp
The Altman Z score is an financial tool created to asses the risk of bankruptcy. It does this by analyses different financial ratios related to: profitability, leverage, liquitidy, and activity. A score of 0 would indicate bankruptcy, and a score of around 3 is a financial healthy company. The formula is: 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C +0.6D + 1.0E
A = working capital/ total assets
B = retained earnings/ total assets
C = earnings before interest and tax/ total assets
D = market value of equity / total liabilities
E = sales / total assets. 



(Ohlson O-score)

The Ohlson score is an weighted combination of different ratios. The O-score is more accurate in predictiong banklruptcy within 2 years compared to the Z-score. A resulst larger than 0.5 suggest that a firm will go bankrupt.

ML models
- Logistic Regression
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression
    It is a statistical/ ML algorithm to try and predict the probability of an discrete outcome, in our case bankrupt vs non-bankrupt. It works by modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (bankruptcy) and multiple independent variables( ratios) to create an S-shaped curve. 
- Random Forest
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/random-forest-algorithm-in-machine-learning/
    This is a ML algorithm that uses decesion trees to make better predictions. Each tree looks at a random part of the data and their results are combined.
